colord (0.1.11-1ubuntu2) oneiric; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/06_use_dbus_security_for_permissions.diff:
    - Patch to allow root and at_console access to access the colord service.
      This matches the default PolicyKit rules.
  * debian/patches/07_fix_disable_polkit_build.diff:
    - Fix the build when passing --disable-polkit
  * debian/rules:
  * debian/control:
    - Disable PolicyKit support, in favour of the dbus security introduced
      above.  PolicyKit is not usable as access control to a non-root service.
